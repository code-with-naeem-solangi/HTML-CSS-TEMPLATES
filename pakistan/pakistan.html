                    Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It was founded in 1947 as a homeland for Muslims
                    of the Indian subcontinent and gained independence from British colonial rule.

                    Islam is the dominant religion in Pakistan, with over 96% of the population being Muslims.
                    Urdu and English are the official languages of the country, although there are many other
                    regional languages spoken as well.

                    Pakistan has a diverse landscape, ranging from snow-capped mountains to deserts and beaches.
                    The country is also rich in history and culture, with ancient civilizations such as the Indus
                    Valley Civilization and Gandhara leaving their mark on the land.

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The Pakistan cricket team made its Test cricket debut in 1952 and has since become one of the most
                    successful
                    teams
                    in modern cricket. The team reached the semi-finals of the 1979,1983, 1987 and 2011 World Cups, and
                    finals
                    in 1992
                    and 1999, and won the 1992 ICC Cricket World Cup by defeating England in the final with the
                    captaincy of
                    Imran Khan
                    They are one of the most successful T20 sides but faced a big failure in T20 2016 having won the T20
                    World
                    Cup in 2009
                    and been runner-up in 2007. And after that they have defeated India by big margin of 180 in the
                    Final of
                    Champions Trophy 2017
                    at The Oval. Pakistan has also been ranked as the Number 1 Test Team twice (summers of 1988 & 2016)
                    and
                    Number 1
                    across all formats (Test, ODI and T20) at various points.[1]</p>

                    1992 World Cup Victory
                    The 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia & New Zealand marked Pakistan's first World Cup victory. It
                    is
                    remembered for the comeback
                    Pakistan made after losing key players such as Waqar Younis and Saeed Anwar, and being led by an
                    injured
                    captain Imran Khan. Pakistan
                    won only 1 of their first 5 matches including a 1 no-result and were nearly eliminated in the first
                    round of
                    the tournament after being
                    bowled out for 74 against England, until the match was declared as a "no result" due to rain.
                    Captain Imran
                    Khan famously told the team
                    to play as "cornered tigers", after which Pakistan won five successive matches, including, most
                    famously,
                    the semi-final against hosts
                    New Zealand and the final against England.[9]
